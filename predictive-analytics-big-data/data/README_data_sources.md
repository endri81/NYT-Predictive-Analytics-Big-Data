# COURSE DATASETS

All datasets used in lectures, classwork, homework, and projects.

## Organization

Datasets are organized by domain:
- `retail/` - E-commerce, sales, transactions
- `healthcare/` - Patient data, outcomes, medical records
- `finance/` - Trading, risk, customer banking
- `social_media/` - User behavior, text, networks

## Data Sources

All datasets are either:
1. Synthetic data generated for pedagogical purposes
2. Publicly available datasets with appropriate licensing
3. Anonymized real-world data with permission

## Ethics and Privacy

Students must treat all data with professional responsibility:
- Do not share datasets outside the course
- Follow all data handling guidelines
- Consider privacy implications in all analyses
- Document data provenance in projects

## Size Considerations

Datasets are sized for laptop computation (typically < 1GB) while remaining pedagogically rich. Big data concepts are taught conceptually alongside practical implementation.
