# WEEK 2: ADVANCED MODELS AND UNSTRUCTURED DATA

## Theme
**Personalization at Scale**

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you will:
- Implement k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms
- Apply dimensionality reduction with PCA
- Build recommendation systems using collaborative filtering
- Process and analyze text data
- Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews
- Handle imbalanced datasets in churn prediction
- Conduct fairness audits on predictive models

## Business Context
Your e-commerce company wants to personalize customer experiences. You must segment the customer base, predict which customers are at risk of churning, and analyze sentiment from product reviews to inform retention strategies.

## Lectures
4. **Clustering Techniques** (Nov 14) - K-means, hierarchical, validation methods
5. **Recommendation Systems** (Nov 15) - Collaborative filtering, content-based, hybrid
6. **Text Analytics** (Nov 16) - Preprocessing, TF-IDF, sentiment analysis

## Project 2: Customer Segmentation and Churn
**Decision:** Which customer segments should we target for retention, and with what interventions?
**Due:** End of Week 2 (Nov 16)

### Deliverables
- Customer segmentation analysis with business interpretation
- Churn prediction model with fairness audit
- Sentiment analysis dashboard from reviews
- Executive presentation on retention strategy
- Complete decision log

## Big Data Connection
This week examines how clustering and text analytics scale to millions of customers and billions of text documents. You'll understand the architectural patterns behind systems like Spotify's recommendation engine.

## Success Metrics
- Identify 4-6 distinct, actionable customer segments
- Churn model achieves AUC > 0.85 with fair performance across segments
- Sentiment analysis provides clear business insights
- Retention strategy is prioritized and resourced
