# WEEK 1: FOUNDATIONS AND PREDICTION

## Theme
**Democratizing Prediction with Supervised Learning**

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you will:
- Understand gradient descent and optimization fundamentals
- Build and validate linear regression models
- Implement logistic regression for classification
- Master model diagnostics and assumption checking
- Apply regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
- Communicate predictive insights to business stakeholders

## Business Context
You are a data scientist at an e-commerce company. Leadership wants to optimize marketing spend and improve customer conversion rates. Your task is to build predictive models that inform budget allocation decisions.

## Lectures
1. **Regression Fundamentals** (Nov 7) - Linear regression, gradient descent, assumptions
2. **Classification Methods** (Nov 8) - Logistic regression, ROC curves, threshold selection
3. **Advanced Regression** (Nov 9) - Regularization, feature engineering, interactions

## Project 1: E-Commerce Sales Optimization
**Decision:** Which marketing channels merit increased investment?
**Due:** End of Week 1 (Nov 9)

### Deliverables
- Exploratory data analysis report
- Sales forecasting regression model
- Customer conversion classification model  
- Business recommendations presentation
- Complete decision log

## Big Data Connection
This week, we explore how laptop-scale regression models conceptually map to distributed systems processing billions of transactions. Every technique you learn has a distributed computing equivalent.

## Success Metrics
- Models achieve validation RÂ² > 0.75 for regression
- Classification models achieve AUC > 0.80
- Business recommendations are actionable and data-driven
- Decision framework is thoroughly documented
