## üéØ LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Perform comprehensive residual analysis on regularized models
2. Identify influential observations using Cook's distance
3. Quantify prediction uncertainty with bootstrap intervals
4. Assess coefficient stability through resampling
5. Create diagnostic dashboards for production readiness
6. Make evidence-based deployment recommendations

**Required from Classwork 4:**
- Trained elastic net model
- Product pricing dataset
- Optimal alpha value
- Train-test split (with seed 123)

## üîß TECHNICAL SETUP

### Required Packages

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "glmnet", "knitr", "kableExtra", "broom"))
```

### File Structure

Ensure your folder structure looks like this:

```
your_workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ classwork_4_elastic_net/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ product_pricing.csv
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ classwork_5_diagnostics/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template.Rmd  # Work here
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Loading Previous Model

The template includes code to:
1. Load data from Classwork 4
2. Recreate the train-test split (same seed)
3. Refit the elastic net model with your optimal alpha

## üìö KEY CONCEPTS

### Residual Diagnostics

**Residual = Actual - Predicted**

Good residuals should:
- Show random scatter (no patterns)
- Be approximately normal
- Have constant variance
- Contain few extreme outliers

### Cook's Distance

Measures influence of each observation:
- D > 4/n suggests influential point
- High influence ‚â† automatic removal
- Investigate: data error or real edge case?

### Prediction Intervals

Quantify uncertainty:
- 95% PI should contain ~95% of new observations
- Width indicates prediction reliability
- Business must accept uncertainty level

### Coefficient Stability

Bootstrap confidence intervals show:
- Which features have robust effects
- Which coefficients are uncertain
- Whether key business drivers are stable

## üí° TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Residual Plots
- Look for patterns (curved trend = missing features)
- Check for fan shape (heteroscedasticity)
- Identify extreme points (potential outliers)

### Q-Q Plot
- Points on line = good
- S-curve = skewness
- Deviations at tails = heavy/light tails

### Cook's Distance
- Most points should be well below threshold
- Investigate high-influence points individually
- Don't automatically remove them

### Bootstrap
- Set seed for reproducibility
- Use at least 100 iterations (200+ better)
- Monitor progress with periodic status messages

### Deployment Decision
- Be honest about limitations
- Consider business context
- Recommend monitoring plan

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Using training residuals:** Always diagnose on test set
2. **Too few bootstrap iterations:** Need 100+ minimum
3. **Ignoring context:** Technical metrics must serve business needs
4. **Auto-removing outliers:** Investigate first, don't blindly delete
5. **Overly optimistic:** Be honest about model weaknesses

---

## üöÄ EXTENSION CHALLENGES

For students who finish early:

1. **Segmented diagnostics:** Analyze separately for low/mid/high price ranges
2. **Feature stability:** What % of bootstrap samples select each feature?
3. **Calibration analysis:** Create binned predicted vs. actual plot
4. **Sensitivity analysis:** Refit without influential points; assess impact
5. **ROI calculation:** Estimate business value vs. prediction uncertainty

## ‚ùì GETTING HELP

- Review lecture slides (Batch 5)
- Check INSTRUCTIONS.md for detailed guidance
- Consult template comments for hints
- Use `?function_name` for R documentation

**Remember:** The goal is not perfect diagnostics, but honest assessment of model readiness for deployment. Being transparent about limitations is a professional strength, not a weakness.

Good luck! üéØ
