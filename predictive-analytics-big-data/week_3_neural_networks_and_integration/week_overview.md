# WEEK 3: NEURAL NETWORKS AND INTEGRATED SYSTEMS

## Theme
**Deploying Intelligence Responsibly**

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you will:
- Understand backpropagation and neural network training
- Implement deep learning models using Keras in R
- Recognize connections between classical ML and neural networks
- Build ensemble models combining multiple approaches
- Design model monitoring and evaluation frameworks
- Conduct ethical assessments of AI systems
- Prepare models for production deployment

## Business Context
Your company is ready to deploy an integrated predictive analytics system. You must combine regression, classification, clustering, and text analytics into a unified pipeline, implement neural networks that improve upon earlier models, and establish governance frameworks for responsible deployment.

## Lectures
7. **Neural Network Fundamentals** (Nov 20) - Architectures, backpropagation, training
8. **Deep Learning Applications** (Nov 21) - CNNs, RNNs, transfer learning, advanced topics
9. **Model Deployment and Ethics** (Nov 22) - Serving, monitoring, bias detection, governance

## Project 3: Integrated Predictive Analytics System
**Decision:** How do we deploy a multi-model system that makes thousands of daily decisions with appropriate oversight?
**Due:** End of Week 3 (Nov 22)

### Deliverables
- System architecture documentation
- Neural network performance comparison
- Ensemble model pipeline
- Ethical assessment and audit framework
- Board-level presentation on AI governance
- Complete decision log with monitoring plan

## Big Data Connection
This week addresses real-time inference at scale, model serving architecture, and MLOps principles. You'll understand how integrated systems handle streaming data and serve predictions to millions of users simultaneously.

## Success Metrics
- Neural network outperforms classical models by >5% on key metrics
- Ensemble approach demonstrates improved robustness
- Ethical assessment identifies and mitigates bias
- Monitoring framework enables ongoing accountability
- Presentation demonstrates executive-level communication

## The Big Picture
Upon completing this project, you have a portfolio demonstrating end-to-end capability: from exploratory analysis through model development to production deployment with ethical safeguards. This is the maturity curve of professional data science.
