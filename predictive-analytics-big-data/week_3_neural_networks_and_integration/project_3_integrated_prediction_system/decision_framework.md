# DECISION FRAMEWORK TEMPLATE

Complete this framework before building any model. Models serve decisions, not the other way around.

## 1. THE DECISION

**What specific decision is being made?**


**Who makes this decision?**


**How frequently is this decision made?**


## 2. THE STAKES

**What happens if we make the right decision?**


**What happens if we make the wrong decision?**


**What is the cost of a false positive?**


**What is the cost of a false negative?**


**Are these costs symmetric or asymmetric?**


## 3. THE ACTION

**What concrete action will be taken based on the model output?**


**What is the intervention threshold?**


**Who implements the action?**


**Is the action reversible?**


## 4. THE CONSTRAINTS

**What are the time constraints for this decision?**


**What are the resource constraints?**


**What are the ethical constraints?**


**What regulatory requirements must be met?**


## 5. THE METRICS

**What metric should we optimize?**


**Why is this the right metric for the decision?**


**What other metrics should we monitor?**


**What is the baseline performance without a model?**


## 6. THE DATA

**What data do we have access to?**


**What data would we need in an ideal world?**


**What are the data quality issues?**


**Are there privacy or security concerns?**


## 7. THE RISKS

**What could go wrong if we deploy this model?**


**How might the model be gamed or manipulated?**


**What are the fairness and bias concerns?**


**What is our plan for monitoring and auditing?**


## 8. THE ALTERNATIVES

**What would we do without a predictive model?**


**What simpler approaches should we try first?**


**When should we revisit this decision framework?**
