# PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS & BIG DATA
## MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics | November 2025

Welcome to the course! This document provides your roadmap for the next three weeks.

## üìã Course Overview

This 9-lecture course transforms you from data science student to job-ready predictive analytics professional. You will build three substantial portfolio projects that demonstrate end-to-end capability in:

- Supervised learning (regression and classification)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction)
- Text analytics and natural language processing
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Model deployment and ethical AI

## üóìÔ∏è Schedule

**Week 1: Foundations and Prediction (Nov 7-9)**
- Lecture 1: Regression Fundamentals
- Lecture 2: Classification Methods
- Lecture 3: Advanced Regression
- **Project 1: E-Commerce Sales Optimization**

**Week 2: Advanced Models and Text (Nov 14-16)**
- Lecture 4: Clustering Techniques
- Lecture 5: Recommendation Systems
- Lecture 6: Text Analytics
- **Project 2: Customer Segmentation and Churn**

**Week 3: Neural Networks and Integration (Nov 20-22)**
- Lecture 7: Neural Network Fundamentals
- Lecture 8: Deep Learning Applications
- Lecture 9: Model Deployment and Ethics
- **Project 3: Integrated Predictive System**

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `utilities/` - Shared R functions for preprocessing, visualization, evaluation
- `data/` - Course datasets organized by domain
- `foundations/` - Mathematical derivations and deeper theory
- `big_data_concepts/` - How these techniques scale to production systems
- `week_X_*/` - Weekly content including lectures and projects
- `resources/` - Case studies, ethics frameworks, career materials

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Review course_progress.md** - Your checklist for the entire course
2. **Check package_requirements.R** - Install necessary R packages
3. **Read decision_framework_guide.md** - Understand the decision-first approach
4. **Explore Week 1 folder** - Begin with lecture_1_regression_fundamentals

## üí° Learning Philosophy

This course emphasizes **decision intelligence**: models exist to enable better decisions. Every assignment requires you to:

1. Define the business decision being made
2. Specify the cost of being wrong
3. Articulate the action driven by the model
4. Document your modeling choices and assumptions

## üìß Questions?

Refer to the README.md files in each folder for specific guidance. Each lecture folder contains a lecture_guide.md with learning objectives.

**Let's build something extraordinary together.**
